! this is bodos database for bpm and raster stuff, could be done much nicer
! do not change the ordering, without proper knowledge
! do not add comments between the [identifier] and the necessary lines
! comments are only allowed after one block finishes and before the next
! block starts with its [identifier]

! lines for the raster, z-pos, freq x and y, pedestal for derivative
!
! Rastered beam
! z-pos for first bpm
! z-pos for second bpm
! z-pos for reference point (should be zero = target)
! last three lines are offx/y,amplx/y,slopex/y for bpma,bpmb,target
! those last three lines are very time dependent, the need to be 
! adjusted for each run, eventually even more often
