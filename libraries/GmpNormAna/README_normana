 GmpNormAna is a class to help normalize the experiment.
 
 The data contained by the class are

        -- prescale factors fetched from analyzer
        -- scaler data from event type 140  
        -- scaler data from ROC10/11 (trigge supervisor)  
                        there better synhronized to events than ev140
        -- trigger supervisor on-board scalers
        -- trigger latch TDC -- provides evtypebits (bit pattern of concurrent triggers)

  From scalers one can obtain

       -- number of triggers in run
       -- integrated charge
       
  There are various ways to compute the deadtime, e.g. using event 140 scalers.
  The best way is to analyze the event type bit pattern (from trigger latch TDC)
  and the scalers from TS0 or TS1

  An alternative way to obtain deadtime is from the TS on-board scalers.

 GmpNormAna is put in the online script like this:

          GmpNormAna* norm = 
               new GmpNormAna("N","Normalization Analysis");
          gHaPhysics->Add(norm);

  And variables   N.*   are added to the output tree, and an an
  end-of-run printout summarizing the analysis is printed.

  To compile, type "make".  You need to control the variable
  ANALYZER in the Makefile, to point to the valid analyzer path.
